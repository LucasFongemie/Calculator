# Right Triangle Calculator

My project is a right triangle calculator using geometric functions.

It is written in Java in an Eclipse workspace.

The code uses a scanner to take user inputs, assigning them to instance variables, and uses them to call methods and solve for any remaining sides or angles.

# Installation

Install Eclipse, open a workspace, then create a file for your project with a package and a class inside that package. Copy down the code, and the results of the code will be printed in the console.

# Project Status

This project solves for right triangles that you input as the user. 

I want to further this project by creating a better user interface other than the console and fixing issues with how the math is computed in code.
